# U.S.-Medical-Insurance-Costs
This project, provided by Codecademy as part of the Data Science Foundations course, explores a dataset of medical insurance costs for individuals in the U.S. using statistical analysis techniques in Python 3.10 and Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need any of the following:
- Python 3.10+ and Jupyter
- Conda environment(s)

Additionally, you can install the `requirements.txt` which contains `matplotlib` package.

## Usage

To run this project, I recommend using Jupyter Notebook.
You can run the notebook by opening the `project.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.

## Personal Notes

Firstly, I want to point out that this is my first Data Science project.
I am really happy with the results.
I have learned a lot about the Python programming language and the Jupyter Notebook environment.
I also want to point out that this is not a data interpretation project.
This is a project that focuses on the use of Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze a dataset.


## Contributing

With the previous in mind, I am not looking for contributions to this project.
I will accept suggestions and minor fixes, but I will not accept any major changes.

This is a finished project.
